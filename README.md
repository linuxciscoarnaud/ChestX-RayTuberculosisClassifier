# Tuberculosis diagnosis implemented with CNN and trained on frontal Chest X-Rays

This is an implementation of a CNN-based tuberculosis diagnosis described in the paper: [Efficient Deep Network Architectures for Fast 
Chest X-Ray Tuberculosis Screening and Visualization](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-42557-4). It makes use of the 
deeplearning4j library. The network is successively trained on two datasets: the Montgomery County chest X-ray set (MC) and the 
Shenzhen chest X-ray set, which can both be found [here](https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/tuberculosis-chest-x-ray-image-data-sets/).
